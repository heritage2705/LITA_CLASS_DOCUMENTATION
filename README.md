### Project Title: E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past year.
By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which
then enable us to tell compelling stories around data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is Dat Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an 
open source online such as Kaggle or FRED or any other repository site.
